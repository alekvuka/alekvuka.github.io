I have to admit: it took a while for me to wrap my head around object orientation.  It took about 2.5 weeks to get a good handle on it and then about a month after that to understand it well. The concept that I had most trouble with is understanding that a model can have multiple instances. 

Looking back, this seems like a pretty straightforward concept. But at the time that I started to first encounter object oriented programing, it seemed like an insurmountable concept. The labs really really helped me at this stage of the program. If I didn't have the structure of the labs at this point, I probably would not have been able to get to the point where I could understand this concept. Each Object Oriented intro lab would take an enormous amount of time for me to complete, but through that trial and error, I was able to work through my conceptual misunderstandings.

 Once I got a good understanding of the model-instance concept it was, ironically, quite straightforward for me to understand how to create relationships between models. In fact, I found grasping the model relationship concepts like  has_many, has_many_through and belongs_to much easier.
