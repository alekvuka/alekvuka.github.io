The first project I built using git and github was a Ruby gem that scraped a website to obtain an organizations org structure. A great aspect about Ruby is that developers can create, publish and download gems! In fact, you can’t really build complex applications in Ruby without incorporating gems that other people have made! A great example of this pry or nokogiri — it would be difficult to scrape a website without nokogiri or debug without pry. That’s why, when I had to build and publish a Ruby Gem, I was pretty excited and, to be completely honest, quite scared! 

Working with git and guthub was an integral part of making that peoject a success. To be honest, I found git and github incredibly intimidating at first. I thought that if i made the wrong move or clicked the wrong button I would either loose all my work or publish to the wrong place. It took a while at first to just get the confidence to push the first commit. 

What helped me a lot was that there are many online resources to learn how to use git and gihub. The one that I found quite useful was github's own guides to setting up new repositories. The step by step instructions that many of the guides had where instrumental in helping me get over my anxieties with useing github and getting me to create and manage projects through git.
