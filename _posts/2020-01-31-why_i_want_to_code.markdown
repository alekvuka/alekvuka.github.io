I worked on a few startups right out of college.  My first one was a company that focused on collecting and analyzing mobile sensor data. We created an SDK that reasearchers could implement into apps that would track participants in the releveant academic, medical or marketing study.  The socond company focused on creating apps that help employers and employees better track time at work. 

In both cases, I focused more on the role of sales and product development than as a coder. And every time I worked with developers directly in these projects, I was super jelous of their superpowers! Whereas I can just design and make specs they can actually build stuff! 

Having the ability to build my own projects or those of my friends was a huge motivation for me. In my previous jobs, I've learned that what i enjoy most is building a tool or a product that would make a meaningful difference for the person using it. Before, I could only dream about or create spects for any of the product ideas I came up with. I'm learning to code so that I don't only have to dream about these products but build them too.
